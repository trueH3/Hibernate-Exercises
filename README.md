# MyHibernate

This is a simple exercise to get familiar with Hibernate ORM. Right now it consists 4 tables. I used relation OneToOne, ManyToOne, ManyToMany between them. I also wrote some queries, using nativeQuery, query, namedQuery As a database I've used MySQL and as an application server - Wildfly.

**Things to do to run program**
1. in MySQL create schema called "test"
2. launch wildfly
3. import maven project using pom.xml
4. in web.xml change user and password to values that correspond your Wildfly account
5. run project and deploy it in WIldfly
